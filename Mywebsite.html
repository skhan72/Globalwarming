<p> Global warming is the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system and its related effects, as part of climate change. </p>

<h3> Causes </h3>

<ol>

<li> Rising Carbon = Rising Temperatures </li>

</ol>

<p> The continual increase in this carbon dioxide fraction is considered to be the main contributor to the global temperature increase known as global warming. Sunshine is a manifestation of solar radiation and when it is absorbed by the surface of the Earth, the surface heats up and emits a different kind of radiation, known as infrared radiation. Carbon dioxide is a special chemical in that it is transparent to solar radiation and yet it absorbs infrared radiation. Thus, the presence of carbon dioxode in our atmosphere allows sunshine to penetrate to the surface but inhibits the emission of infrared radiation to space.
The consequence of the absorption of infrared radiation by carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is that Earth is much warmer than it has any right to expect based upon its distance from the Sun. In fact, Earthâ€™s average surface temperature is 59 degrees Fahrenheit when it would be 0 if carbon dioxide and other such greenhouse gases (like water vapor and methane) did not exist in our atmosphere.</p>
